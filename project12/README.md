# Ansible Refactoring &amp; Static Assignments

This project builds upon the previous project by making improvements of the code and working with the ansible-config-mgt repository. The tasks in this project include refactoring the code, creating assignments and learning to use the imports functionality. Imports allow to effectively re-use previously created playbooks in a new playbook - it allows to organize tasks and reuse them when needed.

For better understanding or Ansible artifacts re-use, refer to [ansible docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse.html).

Steps taken:

1. Jenkins job enhancement

2. Refactor Ansible code by importing other playbooks into site.yml.

3. Configure UAT Webservers with a role ‘Webserver’.

4. Reference ‘Webserver’ role.

5. Commit & Test.
