# Load Balancer Solution With Apache

This project builds upon project 7 further by adding a Load Balancer to distribute the load evenly between the Web Servers. The users will access the application by using a single public IP address/DNS name of the Load Balancer instead of using separate IP addresses/ DNS names of each Web Server. This ensures a single point of entry to the application through the Load Balancer and also helps to create a better user experience by distributing the traffic evenly between the Web Servers. Apache Web Server was configured as the Load Balancer.

A Load Balancer (LB) distributes clientsâ€™ requests among underlying Web Servers and makes sure that the load is distributed in an optimal way.

Below is the architecture of the solution.
