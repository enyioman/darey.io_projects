# Three-Tier Web Solution with WordPress


The objective of this project is to implement a basic web solution using WordPress by building a storage infrastructure on two Linux servers.

The two parts of this project comprise:
- Creating a Linux-based sub-storage system for the web and database layers.
- Installing WordPress and connecting it to a remote MySQL database server.

The steps taken:

1. Launch a web server and build storage volumes.

2. Partition the volumes attached to the EC@ Instance and create logical volumes. 

3. Format and mount the logical volumes.

4. Prepare the Database Server.

5. Install Wordpress on the Web Server.

6. Install MYSQL on the Database Server.

7. Configure Wordpress to work with the Database.
